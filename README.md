# a-star-cities

Project is currently work in progress.

The current implementation is just a simple custom renderer for open street map data.

The map data can be downloaded via the [open street map API](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Downloading_data).
The data must then be saved as .osm file to be used by the program.
